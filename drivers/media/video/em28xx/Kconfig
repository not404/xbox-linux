	  This is an ALSA driver for some Empia 28xx based TV cards.

	  This is not required for em2800/em2820/em2821 boards. However,
	  newer em28xx devices uses Vendor Class for audio, instead of
	  implementing the USB Audio Class. For those chips, this module
	  will enable digital audio.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called em28xx-alsa
