config TOUCHSCREEN_ADS7846
	tristate "ADS 7846/7843 based touchscreens"
	depends on SPI_MASTER
	depends on HWMON = n || HWMON
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a touchscreen interface using the
	  ADS7846 or ADS7843 controller, and your board-specific setup
	  code includes that in its table of SPI devices.

	  If HWMON is selected, and the driver is told the reference voltage
	  on your board, you will also get hwmon interfaces for the voltage
	  (and on ads7846, temperature) sensors of this chip.

	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ads7846.

	depends on PXA_SHARPSL
	default y	
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the driver for the touchscreen on the 
	  Sharp SL-C7xx and SL-Cxx00 series of PDAs.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called corgi_ts.

config TOUCHSCREEN_GUNZE
	tristate "Gunze AHL-51S touchscreen"
	select SERIO
	help
	  Say Y here if you have the Gunze AHL-51 touchscreen connected to
	  your system.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gunze.

	select SERIO
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a MicroTouch (3M) serial touchscreen connected to
	  your system.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mtouch.

config TOUCHSCREEN_MK712
	tristate "ICS MicroClock MK712 touchscreen"
	help
	  Say Y here if you have the ICS MicroClock MK712 touchscreen
	  controller chip in your system.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mk712.

config TOUCHSCREEN_HP600
	tristate "HP Jornada 680/690 touchscreen"
	depends on SH_HP6XX && SH_ADC
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a HP Jornada 680 or 690 and want to
          support the built-in touchscreen.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hp680_ts_input.

config TOUCHSCREEN_PENMOUNT
	tristate "Penmount serial touchscreen"
	select SERIO
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Penmount serial touchscreen connected to
	  your system.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called penmount.

config TOUCHSCREEN_TOUCHRIGHT

config TOUCHSCREEN_UCB1400
	tristate "Philips UCB1400 touchscreen"
	select AC97_BUS
	help
	  This enables support for the Philips UCB1400 touchscreen interface.
	  The UCB1400 is an AC97 audio codec.  The touchscreen interface
	  will be initialized only after the ALSA subsystem has been
	  brought up and the UCB1400 detected.  You therefore have to
	  configure ALSA support as well (either built-in or modular,
	  independently of whether this driver is itself built-in or
	  modular) for this driver to work.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ucb1400_ts.
