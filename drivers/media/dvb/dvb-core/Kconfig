	  to build your drivers outside the kernel, but need the DVB core. All

	help
	  Remove the static dependency of DVB card drivers on all
	  frontend modules for all possible card variants. Instead,
	  allow the card drivers to only load the frontend modules
	  they require. This saves several KBytes of memory.

	  Note: You will need module-init-tools v3.2 or later for this feature.

	  If unsure say Y.
