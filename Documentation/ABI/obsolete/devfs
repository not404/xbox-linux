Description:
	devfs has been unmaintained for a number of years, has unfixable
	races, contains a naming policy within the kernel that is
	against the LSB, and can be replaced by using udev.
	The files fs/devfs/*, include/linux/devfs_fs*.h will be removed,
	along with the the assorted devfs function calls throughout the
	kernel tree.
