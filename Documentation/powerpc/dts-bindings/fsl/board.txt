* Board Control and Status (BCSR)

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "fsl,<board>-bcsr"
 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

Example:

	bcsr@f8000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8360mds-bcsr";
		reg = <f8000000 8000>;
	};

* Freescale on board FPGA

This is the memory-mapped registers for on board FPGA.

Required properities:
- compatible : should be "fsl,fpga-pixis".
- reg : should contain the address and the lenght of the FPPGA register
  set.

Example (MPC8610HPCD):

	board-control@e8000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,fpga-pixis";
		reg = <0xe8000000 32>;
	};
