config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	tristate "Support for VIA PadLock ACE"
	depends on X86_32
	select CRYPTO_ALGAPI
	default m
	help
	  Some VIA processors come with an integrated crypto engine
	  (so called VIA PadLock ACE, Advanced Cryptography Engine)
	  that provides instructions for very fast cryptographic
	  operations with supported algorithms.
	  
	  The instructions are used only when the CPU supports them.
	  Otherwise software encryption is used.

	  Selecting M for this option will compile a helper module
	  padlock.ko that should autoload all below configured
	  algorithms. Don't worry if your hardware does not support
	  some or all of them. In such case padlock.ko will
	  simply write a single line into the kernel log informing
	  about its failure but everything will keep working fine.

	  If you are unsure, say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock.ko

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES
	tristate "PadLock driver for AES algorithm"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for AES algorithm.

	  Available in VIA C3 and newer CPUs.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-aes.ko

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_SHA
	tristate "PadLock driver for SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	select CRYPTO_SHA256
	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for SHA1/SHA256 algorithms.

	  Available in VIA C7 and newer processors.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-sha.ko
