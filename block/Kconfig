# Block layer core configuration

#XXX - it makes sense to enable this only for 32-bit subarch's, not for x86_64
#for instance.
config LBD
	bool "Support for Large Block Devices"
	depends on X86 || (MIPS && 32BIT) || PPC32 || (S390 && !64BIT) || SUPERH || UML
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to attach large (bigger than 2TB) discs to
	  your machine, or if you want to have a raid or loopback device
	  bigger than 2TB.  Otherwise say N.

config BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE
	bool "Support for tracing block io actions"
	depends on SYSFS
	select RELAY
	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here, if you want to be able to trace the block layer actions
	  on a given queue. Tracing allows you to see any traffic happening
	  on a block device queue. For more information (and the user space
	  support tools needed), fetch the blktrace app from:

	  git://brick.kernel.dk/data/git/blktrace.git

config LSF
	bool "Support for Large Single Files"
	depends on X86 || (MIPS && 32BIT) || PPC32 || ARCH_S390_31 || SUPERH || UML
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to handle very large files (bigger
	  than 2TB), otherwise say N.

	  If unsure, say Y.
