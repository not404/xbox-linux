	depends on NET_ETHERNET && (BROKEN || !S390)
	help
	  Ethernet controllers are usually attached to PHY
	  devices.  This option provides infrastructure for
	  managing PHY devices.

config MARVELL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Marvell PHYs"
	depends on PHYLIB
	---help---
	  Currently has a driver for the 88E1011S
	
config DAVICOM_PHY

	depends on PHYLIB
	---help---
	  Currently supports dm9161e and dm9131

config FIXED_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for PHY emulation on fixed speed/link"
	depends on PHYLIB
	---help---
	  Adds the driver to PHY layer to cover the boards that do not have any PHY bound,
	  but with the ability to manipulate with speed/link in software. The relavant MII
	  speed/duplex parameters could be effectively handled in user-specified  fuction.
	  Currently tested with mpc866ads.

	bool "Emulation for 10M Fdx fixed PHY behavior"
	depends on FIXED_PHY

config FIXED_MII_100_FDX
	bool "Emulation for 100M Fdx fixed PHY behavior"
	depends on FIXED_PHY
