	  	    v9fs: Plan 9 Resource Sharing for Linux
		    =======================================

ABOUT
=====

v9fs is a Unix implementation of the Plan 9 9p remote filesystem protocol.

This software was originally developed by Ron Minnich <rminnich@lanl.gov>
and Maya Gokhale <maya@lanl.gov>.  Additional development by Greg Watson
<gwatson@lanl.gov> and most recently Eric Van Hensbergen
<ericvh@gmail.com>, Latchesar Ionkov <lucho@ionkov.net> and Russ Cox
<rsc@swtch.com>.

USAGE
=====

For remote file server:

	mount -t 9p 10.10.1.2 /mnt/9

For Plan 9 From User Space applications (http://swtch.com/plan9)

	mount -t 9p `namespace`/acme /mnt/9 -o proto=unix,uname=$USER

OPTIONS
=======

  proto=name	select an alternative transport.  Valid options are
  		currently:
 			unix - specifying a named pipe mount point
 			tcp  - specifying a normal TCP/IP connection
 			fd   - used passed file descriptors for connection
                                (see rfdno and wfdno)

  uname=name	user name to attempt mount as on the remote server.  The
  		server may override or ignore this value.  Certain user
		names may require authentication.

  aname=name	aname specifies the file tree to access when the server is
  		offering several exported file systems.

  debug=n	specifies debug level.  The debug level is a bitmask.
  			0x01 = display verbose error messages
			0x02 = developer debug (DEBUG_CURRENT)
			0x04 = display 9p trace
			0x08 = display VFS trace
			0x10 = display Marshalling debug
			0x20 = display RPC debug
			0x40 = display transport debug
			0x80 = display allocation debug

  rfdno=n	the file descriptor for reading with proto=fd

  wfdno=n	the file descriptor for writing with proto=fd

  maxdata=n	the number of bytes to use for 9p packet payload (msize)

  port=n	port to connect to on the remote server

  noextend	force legacy mode (no 9p2000.u semantics)

  uid		attempt to mount as a particular uid

  gid		attempt to mount with a particular gid

  afid		security channel - used by Plan 9 authentication protocols

  nodevmap	do not map special files - represent them as normal files.
  		This can be used to share devices/named pipes/sockets between
		hosts.  This functionality will be expanded in later versions.

RESOURCES
=========

The Linux version of the 9p server is now maintained under the npfs project
on sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/npfs).

There are user and developer mailing lists available through the v9fs project
on sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/v9fs).

News and other information is maintained on SWiK (http://swik.net/v9fs).

Bug reports may be issued through the kernel.org bugzilla 
(http://bugzilla.kernel.org)

STATUS
======

The 2.6 kernel support is working on PPC and x86.
