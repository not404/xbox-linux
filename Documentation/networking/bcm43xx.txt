			BCM43xx Linux Driver Project
			============================

About this software
-------------------

The goal of this project is to develop a linux driver for Broadcom
BCM43xx chips, based on the specification at 
http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net/

The project page is http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/


Requirements
------------

1)	Linux Kernel 2.6.16 or later
	http://www.kernel.org/

	You may want to configure your kernel with:

	CONFIG_DEBUG_FS (optional):
		-> Kernel hacking
		  -> Debug Filesystem

2)	SoftMAC IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack extension and patched ieee80211
	modules:
	http://softmac.sipsolutions.net/

3)	Firmware Files

	Please try fwcutter. Fwcutter can extract the firmware from various 
	binary driver files. It supports driver files from Windows, MacOS and 
	Linux. You can get fwcutter from http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/.
	Also, fwcutter comes with a README file for further instructions.
