config NEW_LEDS
	bool "LED Support"
	help
	  Say Y to enable Linux LED support.  This allows control of supported
	  LEDs from both userspace and optionally, by kernel events (triggers).

	  This is not related to standard keyboard LEDs which are controlled
	  via the input system.

config LEDS_CLASS
	tristate "LED Class Support"
	depends NEW_LEDS
	help
	  This option enables the led sysfs class in /sys/class/leds.  You'll
	  need this to do anything useful with LEDs.  If unsure, say N.

config LEDS_CORGI
	tristate "LED Support for the Sharp SL-C7x0 series"
	depends LEDS_CLASS && PXA_SHARP_C7xx
	help
	  This option enables support for the LEDs on Sharp Zaurus
	  SL-C7x0 series (C700, C750, C760, C860).

config LEDS_LOCOMO
	tristate "LED Support for Locomo device"
	depends LEDS_CLASS && SHARP_LOCOMO
	help
	  This option enables support for the LEDs on Sharp Locomo.
	  Zaurus models SL-5500 and SL-5600.

config LEDS_SPITZ
	tristate "LED Support for the Sharp SL-Cxx00 series"
	depends LEDS_CLASS && PXA_SHARP_Cxx00
	help
	  This option enables support for the LEDs on Sharp Zaurus
	  SL-Cxx00 series (C1000, C3000, C3100).

config LEDS_IXP4XX
	tristate "LED Support for GPIO connected LEDs on IXP4XX processors"
	depends LEDS_CLASS && ARCH_IXP4XX
	help
	  This option enables support for the LEDs connected to GPIO
	  outputs of the Intel IXP4XX processors.  To be useful the
	  particular board must have LEDs and they must be connected
	  to the GPIO lines.  If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TOSA
	tristate "LED Support for the Sharp SL-6000 series"
	depends LEDS_CLASS && PXA_SHARPSL
	help
	  This option enables support for the LEDs on Sharp Zaurus
	  SL-6000 series.

config LEDS_S3C24XX
	tristate "LED Support for Samsung S3C24XX GPIO LEDs"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS && ARCH_S3C2410
	help
	  This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines
	  on Samsung S3C24XX series CPUs, such as the S3C2410 and S3C2440.

comment "LED Triggers"

config LEDS_TRIGGERS
	bool "LED Trigger support"
	depends NEW_LEDS
	help
	  This option enables trigger support for the leds class.
	  These triggers allow kernel events to drive the LEDs and can
	  be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"
	depends LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer
	  via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

config LEDS_TRIGGER_IDE_DISK
	bool "LED IDE Disk Trigger"
	depends LEDS_TRIGGERS && BLK_DEV_IDEDISK
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by IDE disk activity.
	  If unsure, say Y.
