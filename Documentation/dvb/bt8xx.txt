How to get the Nebula Electronics DigiTV, Pinnacle PCTV Sat, Twinhan DST + clones working
=========================================================================================

1) General information
======================

This class of cards has a bt878a chip as the PCI interface.
The different card drivers require the bttv driver to provide the means
to access the i2c bus and the gpio pins of the bt8xx chipset.

2) Compilation rules for Kernel >= 2.6.12
=========================================

Enable the following options:

"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices"
 => "Video For Linux" => "BT848 Video For Linux"
"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices"
 => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support" "Nebula/Pinnacle PCTV/TwinHan PCI Cards"

3) Loading Modules, described by two approaches
===============================================

In general you need to load the bttv driver, which will handle the gpio and
i2c communication for us, plus the common dvb-bt8xx device driver,
which is called the backend.
The frontends for Nebula DigiTV (nxt6000), Pinnacle PCTV Sat (cx24110),
TwinHan DST + clones (dst and dst-ca) are loaded automatically by the backend.
For further details about TwinHan DST + clones see /Documentation/dvb/ci.txt.

3a) The manual approach
-----------------------

Loading modules:
modprobe bttv
modprobe dvb-bt8xx

Unloading modules:
modprobe -r dvb-bt8xx
modprobe -r bttv

3b) The automatic approach
--------------------------

If not already done by installation, place a line either in
/etc/modules.conf or in /etc/modprobe.conf containing this text:
alias char-major-81	bttv

Then place a line in /etc/modules containing this text:
dvb-bt8xx

Reboot your system and have fun!
