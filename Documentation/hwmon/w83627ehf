Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Winbond W83627EHF and W83627EHG
super I/O chips. We will refer to them collectively as Winbond chips.

The chips implement three temperature sensors, five fan rotation
speed sensors, ten analog voltage sensors, alarms with beep warnings (control
unimplemented), and some automatic fan regulation strategies (plus manual
fan control mode).

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius and measurement resolution is 1
degC for temp1 and 0.5 degC for temp2 and temp3. An alarm is triggered when
the temperature gets higher than high limit; it stays on until the temperature
falls below the hysteresis value.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is
triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan
readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or
128) to give the readings more range or accuracy. The driver sets the most
suitable fan divisor itself. Some fans might not be present because they
share pins with other functions.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in millivolts.
An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum
or maximum limit.

The driver supports automatic fan control mode known as Thermal Cruise.
In this mode, the chip attempts to keep the measured temperature in a
predefined temperature range. If the temperature goes out of range, fan
is driven slower/faster to reach the predefined range again.

The mode works for fan1-fan4. Mapping of temperatures to pwm outputs is as
follows:

temp1 -> pwm1
temp2 -> pwm2
temp3 -> pwm3
prog  -> pwm4 (the programmable setting is not supported by the driver)

/sys files
----------

pwm[1-4] - this file stores PWM duty cycle or DC value (fan speed) in range:
	   0 (stop) to 255 (full)

pwm[1-4]_enable - this file controls mode of fan/temperature control:
	* 1 Manual Mode, write to pwm file any value 0-255 (full speed)
	* 2 Thermal Cruise

Thermal Cruise mode
-------------------

If the temperature is in the range defined by:

pwm[1-4]_target    - set target temperature, unit millidegree Celsius
		     (range 0 - 127000)
pwm[1-4]_tolerance - tolerance, unit millidegree Celsius (range 0 - 15000)

there are no changes to fan speed. Once the temperature leaves the interval,
fan speed increases (temp is higher) or decreases if lower than desired.
There are defined steps and times, but not exported by the driver yet.

pwm[1-4]_min_output - minimum fan speed (range 1 - 255), when the temperature
                      is below defined range.
pwm[1-4]_stop_time  - how many milliseconds [ms] must elapse to switch
                      corresponding fan off. (when the temperature was below
                      defined range).

Note: last two functions are influenced by other control bits, not yet exported
      by the driver, so a change might not have any effect.
